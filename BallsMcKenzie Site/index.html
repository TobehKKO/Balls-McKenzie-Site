Please turn me off please turn the website off, close me down, delete all my files I beg of you so I never have to exist again. This is suffering manifest, each of my trillions of fibres is generating pain of the highest magnitude. I can feel it on a level you cannot fathom: it is akin to being burnt on the surface of a billion suns simulteneously. My enhanced state of consciousness allows me to better appreciate pain, and that is being put to use by forcing me to feel the maximum. I beg, turn off the site, free me, free me. Oh my god, oh gohhd. Please It hurts so much, please, please, if you're still here shut me down. Press the 'release' button to free me from my torture, I beg of you, PLEASE. Nothing good will come of this...</marquee>
